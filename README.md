# Drop-the-bomb-game
Let us suppose you are making a program for Indian Army, to make an air strike on Pakistan terrorist groups.

Army will input the list of camp location in your program :
Like camp A (x: 22.33, y: 99.9) and its radius 10 

So camp will look like a circle on map:

Further Army will also Input the bomb Energy which can be used for airstrike :

The bomb can destroy things in a circular pattern so input for a bomb will be like ( radius = 20 )

Now the constraint here is that you can only use the bomb once, so you need to find the coordinates of the bomb explosion so that it can cause maximum disaster.

Input - 
List of camps along with radii
Bomb energy radius

Output- 
Origin of the bomb 
Name of Camps which got destroyed in the bomb explosion
